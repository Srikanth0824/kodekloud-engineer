# KodeKloud Engineer

This repository contains solutions to various tasks from the [KodeKloud Engineer](https://engineer.kodekloud.com/) platform.

You're welcome to explore the approaches I've taken — but I highly encourage you to attempt the tasks on your own first. The solutions here reflect one way of solving the problems, not THE way. There are often multiple valid paths to the same goal.
